This is a program replicating a car rental system by utilizing **C++ Object Oriented Programming** and features from the **OpenCV** library.

* The first console page contains a **login** page where the user is prompted to input a password ("welcome") in order to continue further.
* Then the available cars for rent are displayed and the user is prompted to choose.
* After, they make their choice details + a photo (**OpenCV**) about the specific vehicle are displayed.
* The user is asked to confirm their choice and input basic verification details.
* In the end, using the **OpenCV** libary a window opens which scans for the face of the customer and after getting a clear picture it is saved to the device.
